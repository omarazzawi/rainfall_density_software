## Introduction
**The Rain Density Calculator** is a Python-based application built for engineers, hydrologists, and water resource professionals to record, calculate, and analyze rainfall intensity across defined surface areas. By integrating directly with Google Sheets as its database, the tool enables users to easily log, review, and process rainfall data. It offers a simple yet effective solution for managing rainfall density records and tracking changes over time.

## Features

- **Data Entry:** Enter new monthly rainfall records, including the year, month,  total rain volume, and the collection area.
- **On-the-fly Calculation:** Use a built-in calculator to compute rainfall density for any given volume and area without saving the data.
- **Data Persistence:** All entered data is securely saved and managed in a dedicated Google Sheet, providing a single source of truth.
- **Data Persistence:** All entered data is securely saved and managed in a dedicated Google Sheet, providing a single source of truth.
- **Historical Overview:** View a list of past rainfall entries stored in your Google Sheet.
- **12-Month Average:** Automatically calculate and display the average rainfall density for the last 12 unique months with data.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** The program seamlessly handles the connection, creation, and population of your Google Sheet. It even provides a helpful hint on how to export your data as a CSV file for further analysis.
